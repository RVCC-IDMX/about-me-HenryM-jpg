### Description
This about me project was a way to showcase my capabilities building a website using HTML and CSS. Developing the Hero, Bio, and Hobbies sections taught me the basic elements of HTML. Developing the look of the website taught me the basics of CSS. I learned how to create several media states and how to implement responsive design. Developing the gallery section taught me to use images, flex and grid, and taught me about hover effects in CSS. The blog section taught me about flex and grid as well as how to style dropcaps in CSS. Developing the video section taught me about embedded media and Iframes. The form section taught me to create a contact form that could recieve information from a user. Developing the Navigation section taught me about developing a functional hamburger icon using CSS.
